# hello-world

Hi all, 

Chris here. I'm on an adventure to discover interesting insights into the world using big data analytics. My skill level is beginner. I'm currently living in SF, California. I work as a full-time portfolio strategy and design analyst supporting the sales team at a high-net-worth investment management firm.
